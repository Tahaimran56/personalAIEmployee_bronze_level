# Specification Quality Checklist: Bronze Tier Foundation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Details**:
- Spec documents a completed implementation (Bronze tier)
- All 20 functional requirements are clear and testable
- 12 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 4 user stories with complete acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases identified and documented
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly listed
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present

## Notes

This specification documents an already-completed Bronze tier implementation. All components have been built, tested, and verified. The spec serves as documentation of what was accomplished and provides a baseline for Silver tier planning.

**Ready for**: Documentation and Silver tier planning (no further implementation needed for Bronze tier)
